# Abstraction in Computers

> The goal of "abstracting" [...] is to reduce complexity by removing unnecessary information [<cite>[1]</cite>]

The concept of abstraction itself has been used in computers ever since they were created. Computers work on complex concepts that are split into different layers.

> Abstraction is done with Layers. Each Layer makes the usage of it's underlying layer simpler.

Everbody knows, computers only understand 0 and 1. Programming, however is not done by using zeros and ones. It is done by using readable code. So there must be something in between, something that somehow translates code into 1 and 0. This is where layers join the game. 

Layers are here to abstract the layer beneath it. Computers work on many, many layers. So from a user input, like the press of a key on the keyboard, many different layers are involved, before that command reaches the 1 and 0 level.

Every programming code runs on a pretty high layer of that stack, meaning that code is a layer of abstraction that is fairly simple, compared to the 0 and 1 layer. 

Therefore a programmer usually doesn't have to deal with zeroes and ones.
