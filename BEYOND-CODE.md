# Programming beyond Code

> Programing isn't always just done with code.

Of course, code is the most common way to program software. But there are other ways to develop software beyond code.

Code is a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do, remember?

Code is also (pretty much) the lowest level to describe there instructions. But over time, people have found ways to make programming possible not just by writing code, but by providing more abstract ways to develop. This is done by adding some layers on top of some code, tht has already be written and ist helt generalistic.

Common examples are WYSIWYG programming tools.
