# Abstract Code - What?

> First of all, there is no official definition of "Abstract Code". I'll be using this term to describe the principle of this publication.

When you google "Abstract Code", you'll mainly find results that have to do with the concept of [Abstraction](...).
And the Idea of Abstraction is actually a good point to start. You can read more about abstraction [here]().

What the concept of this publication is about, is finding a way to develop software without the (full) complexity of general purpose programming languages while still having the (full) flexibility of general purpose programming languages.

Naturally, the above statement sounds conflicting -  and hard to achieve. And it is.
This is why concepts, like Low Code Programming have evolved in the last couple of years.

Let's talk about the three main conpepts of abstract code programing. These concepts actually represent the name of this whole thing:

* Abstract (as in abstraction)
* Code (computer code)
* Programming (the process of coding)
