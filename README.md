## Author

My name is Marco, a Computer Science Master with a deep passion for abstraction. I am working on this site to provide a platform for people who want to build software in a simple but versatile fashion. I really hope this site will be joined by other collaborators, exchainging ideas, concepts and solutions for making computer programming more abstract.
