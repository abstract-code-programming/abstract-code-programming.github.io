# Abstract Code Programming

![Banner](assets/acp-banner.png "Banner")

Welcome to "Abstract Code Programming". This publication is to show and discuss approaches for building software using ***real programming*** code in an abstract and versatile way. Approaches, that go beyond hard-core programming but also beyond "Low Code". You will:

* ***Learn*** about abstract ways to develop software
* ***See*** different approaches for different problems
* ***Develop*** software using abstract programming languages


### TL;DR

Abstract Code Programing doesn't have an official definition. It is discussed here as a development approach that aims to provide a way to develop software using programming languages that are designed with abstract principles.

# Projects

As part of this publication, some technologies that make abstract codeing possible, are being created and discussed. There technologies are open source.


### Ressources: This publication

This publication is the main part of the abstact code project.

### Abstract Programming Language: PUZZLE

When we talk about abstract code, we need an abstract programming language. The PUZZLE project is an approach to create a real programmming language, that is designed with abstraction in mind. Along with the resources shown in this publication, PUZZLE will be discussed.

### Abstract Framework: OBJY

Besides having a language for development, frameworks are a must-use for building software. OBJY is a framework, that works with behaviour-driven, dynamic objects as piece of abstraction.
